# Libft
## Your very first own library

### Summary:
This project is about coding a C library. \
It will contain a lot of general purpose functions your programs will rely upon.

## Chapter I
### Introduction
C programming can be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to the highly useful 
standard functions. This project is about understanding the way these functions work,
implementing and learning to use them. Your will create your own library. It will be
helpful since you will use it in your next C school assignments. \
Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year. However, when working
on a new project, don’t forget to ensure the functions used in your library are allowed in
the project guidelines.

## Chapter II
### Mandatory part
### Technical considerations
• Declaring global variables is forbidden. \
• If you need helper functions to split a more complex function, define them as static 
functions. This way, their scope will be limited to the appropriate file. \
• Place all your files at the root of your repository. \
• Turning in unused files is forbidden. \
• Every .c files must compile with the flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror. \
• You must use the command ar to create your library. Using the libtool command
is forbidden. \
• Your libft.a has to be created at the root of your repository
